```
#define RS PORTBbits.RB5
#define E PORTBbits.RB4
#define D4 PORTBbits.RB6
#define D5 PORTBbits.RB7
#define D6 PORTAbits.RA6
#define D7 PORTAbits.RA7
```

### Documentation
The provided library is very easy to use. You have to first Create a `LCDScreen` object then initialize it by using `LCDScreen_init(&lcd_object_name)`  
Here is an example :  
```
LCDScreen lcd;

void main(void) {
    
    //Mise de tous les port en sortie 
    TRISA &= 0x00;
    TRISB &= 0x00;

    CMCON = 0x07; //DÃ©sactivation des comparateurs

    PORTA = 0b00000000;
    PORTB = 0x00;
    
    __delay_ms(50);
    LCDScreen_init(&lcd);
    lcd.cursor_blink();
    
    while(1){
        //Do your stuff
    }
    return;
}
```
Here is some information about library's functions  
`lcd.cursor_blink()` : Enable / Disable cursor blinking  
`lcd.write(char c)` : Write a character  at the cursor position  
`lcd.print(int x, int y, char *str)` : Write a message at column x and line y   
`lcd.clear()` : Clear the LCD display
